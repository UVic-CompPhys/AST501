## Elements of the research proposal

1. Find an interesting problem. Why is important, why does matter, what is a possible broader impact?
2. What has been done before on this problem, state of the art
3. Why is that state-of-the-art insufficient, what aspect has not been addressed, or which aspect should be looked at again?
4. From the previous points should follow: What I am going to do, describe the scope (goals and objectives)
5. Feasibility and risks, are the methods proposed suitable for the goals (time line)

Part 4 and 5 would be ideally based on some _rapid proto-typing_ or *back-of-the-envelope estimates* of your ideas. 



## Expectation for presentation

Here are some key points to consider that I will use in finding my grade:

* Content of presentation:
   - motivate the problem, why is it interesting, what is the impact, why should anyone care
   - state of the art
   - what are your goals and objective
   - methods and assumptions
   - results
   - discussion, conclusion, outlook
   
* Clarity of presentation, are the slides appropriate to support the message, and do the spoken words match the visual, staying on time

* Answer questions appropriately

### How to submit your work

Make a **channel on Mattermost** with the name `ASTR501_24_projectname` and submit your presentation slides to that channel. Add all class students to your channel. All discussions regarding your project will take place in that channel. As the project progresses you can post intermediate results or questions to the channel. You can use the channel as a log of your work, posting for example references, or intermediate results you don't want to forget. When you write up your report or prepare your final presentation those posts may be very useful. 

## Expectations for final report:

* Use the paper template of one of the standard astronomy journals, e.g. PASP, ApJ etc
* The report should have the form and style of a paper
* The length should be about the length of a letter, for ApJ this would be 4-5 pages, including figures. An appendix can be added with supplemental material and figures, if you feel you have additional results you want to document but maybe don't have space to discuss and include in the main part. Any appendix will only count little toward the grade. 
* Submit your pdf paper to the channel, also submit the path to a directory on the astrohub (depending on which hub you have been working in) in a place that I can access with a README.md file and all the notebooks needed to make the figures in your paper. The README.md file has a subsection header for each figure with a pointer to the notebook in which the figure has been made and any comment I would need to read. part of the grade will be that I can make each figure. 



### Structure of a paper in astronomy

What follows is the general structure of a paper in astronomy. There is no reason not to adhere to it:

#### Title
The title is an abstract of the abstract. Ideally it should not only say what the paper is about but if possible also what the main result is. 

#### Abstract
The abstract summarizes not what has been done but what the main results are. Being quantitative is a bonus! The abstract should make the reader want to read the paper.

#### Introduction
The introduction has the following elements, and they must be presented in this order:
* What is the topic about and why is the topic important and interesting? What is the key question that needs answering?
* What has been done by previous researchers to address the question? Including the relevant references. Why is the status-quo described insufficient, why is there a need for more work?
* What will this paper do, and what will it **not** do (defining the scope including the limits of the investigation is key!)
* The last paragraph gives a brief account of what each following section will do.

#### Methods
Some variations are possible here, But in general this section describes the methodology and the assumptions that have been made. Which codes and which data has been used? Assumptions of the data used etc.  This can include a description of  the simulation techniques, maybe even the mathematical equations that are solved, depending on how much of this has been described before and can be referenced. It a number of simulations have been run they could be described (not the results) and summarized, for example in a table.

#### Results
This is the key section of the paper. The main results are described. Figures appear in the order in which they are called out. Figure labels and legends have at most one size down in font size compared to the text of the paper. Figure captions describe what can be seen in the figure, not the meaning or implication of what is shown. That is described in the text. Conversely, in the text you do not describe what can be seen in the figures, e.g. _the blue dashed line shows ..._ or _as can be seen from the blue-dashed line ..._. This belongs in the figure caption. Figure lines need to be distinguished with shape, colour and if appropriate with markers. Use colorblind friendly colors. 

Understand that many people will "read" your paper by reading the title, the abstract and look at the figures, so select your figures carefully. It should be possible to get the main point of a paper from the abstract and the figures. The sequence of figures should tell the main story. Imagine you put just the figures on a poster and go to a conference. Can you tell the story of the paper by just discussing the results shown in the figures one after another? The text is mostly there to justify your claims and deal with the doubters. Results are not discussed in any major fashion. 

#### Discussion and conclusion
The discussion includes a comparison with results from others, and it assesses in how far the goals of the paper have been accomplished. It may start with a brief summary of key results, can be done in a bullet list.

The conclusions outline what remains to be done and what the next interesting open questions are to be tackled in this line of research. Provide an outlook.

### Some general comments
*  As you research your project topic you will have to look at a few papers. Consciously try to identify the structure outlined above. If you can't identify the structure because it is really not there you should probably ignore that particular paper.
*  It is a common challenge for students to learn that the paper does not report what you have done, but what the methods and results are! 
* **Each statement must be backed up** either by a reference or by original research presented in the paper!
* People have different strategies about writing such a text; my recommendation is the following:
  1. Write the title and abstract, in the abstract anticipate what you think your main results will be, understanding that you will rewrite the abstract at the end.
  2. Set up the sections, write a bullet list with 3-5 points what each section or subsection is going to contain.
  3. Put in the Figure Latex environment for each figure, commenting the actual include command, but write out a draft of the figure caption, e.g. plan out the figures. Make the figures and insert them, can be draft figure, but based on real data.
  4. Once you think you are done with figures, and the figures tell the story of the paper, check if the figures align with the bullet points. This is the time when you check for overall balance. Only then start to fill in the text. In a first round just write fast and don't worry about the best words, just put rough text in each section all the way to the end. 
  5. At this point check the balance of the overall paper again, this is your last chance to change figures, but if you are making dramatic changes at this point you have done something wrong in a previous step.
  6. When you are happy and have committed to the figures, then spend the rest of your time improving the text and making the figures nice. For the text do two iterations. In the first you make sure that the text actually says what you want to say, checking for clear and unambiguous language; in the second and maybe even last iteration you are reading again and you ask each phrase, word and sentence if it **has** to be there by checking if it can be deleted - you will be surprised by how much you can shorten the text. Beginners use too many words that are not necessary. The shorter you text the better because you are increasing the textual signal to noise by weeding out text that is not absolutely needed. Keep in mind that your readers attention is your most valuable asset that must be spent very carefully.
