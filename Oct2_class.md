# Quiz questions

**Question 1:** Explain why stellar evolution models typically use a simplified version of the conservation laws. What are the limitations and why are they necessary? What are the implications and limitations of this approach?

* Dimensional simplifications
* Dynamical simplifications
* Energy transport simplifications
* Timescales 
  * Thermal E_int / L
  * Nuclear exhaust nuclear fuel
  * Dynamic 
* Computational feasibility: why exactly

**Question 2:** What are the main physical processes of energy transport in stars. In stellar evolution models, how is the transition between radiative and convective energy transport determined? Discuss the physical principles involved and how this impacts our understanding of stellar structure and evolution.

**Question 3:** Explain how the recurring process of thermal pulses and third dredge-up events during the AGB phase contributes to the chemical enrichment of the stellar envelope and potentially the interstellar medium. How does this relate to the concept of primary and secondary element production?

**Question 4:** Describe the key physical processes that drive a star’s evolution during the post-AGB phase. How do these processes determine the star’s path in the HR diagram, and what factors influence whether a star experiences a *born-again* episode?
